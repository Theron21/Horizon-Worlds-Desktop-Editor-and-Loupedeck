# Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor and Loupedeck
- I came up with a solution to make editing easier in Horizon worlds by using a Loupedeck CT.  
- I am providing an example Auto Hot Key (AHK) script and also the loupedeck profile lp5 file.  A Loupedeck CT was used when creating this solution.
- You can install the, Loupedeck application, and impoprt the lp5 profile.  Then download AHK v2 and provide the AHK file.  There are configurables in the AHK file if you want to further fine tune the solution for your needs.
